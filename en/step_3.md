## Generate an Image with SDXL Turbo

### Using the Script

--- task ---

Type the following command into the terminal and press `Enter` to run the script:

```bash
./run_sd.sh
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You will be asked to enter a prompt. This is a description of the image you want to generate. The prompt guides the image generation process by describing the desired scene or object. If you want to know more about prompting an AI image generator, [have a look at the project here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/ai-image-prompt/){:target="_blank"}. 


```bash
Enter the prompt: A cat
```

Press Enter.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Next, enter the number of steps. This affects the quality of the image. More steps generally result in higher quality images, as the model has more opportunities to refine the output. It takes around 1 minute per step on a Raspberry Pi 5 with 4Gb RAM.

```bash
Enter the number of steps: 5
```

Press Enter.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Enter the name of the image file. This is the name your generated image will be saved as.

```bash
Enter the output image file name: cat.png
```

Press Enter.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Wait for the image to generate.

The script will now run with your inputs and generate the image. This may take a few moments depending on the number of steps and your computerâ€™s performance.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Check the Output

Once the process is complete, you will find your generated image saved with the specified file name, in the current directory.

By following these steps, you can easily generate images using the script. The prompt defines what the image will depict, the number of steps influences its quality, and the file name determines where it will be saved. Enjoy creating your images!
